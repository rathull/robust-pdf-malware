# Robust PDF Malware

## Project Goals
PDFs are one of the most popular formats to access documents, it is crucial that the level of security keeps up with their usage. This project introduces two approaches to analyzing the security of PDF documents: first, by creating adversarial examples of malicious and non-malicious PDFs (through noise injection) to spoof standard PDF malware detectors such as VirusTotal, and second, by fine-tuning ResNet18 to identify malicious PDFs based on their Markov plots.
